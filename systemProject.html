                <p>
                    This project was for my Computer Science A-Level, where we were tasked to come up with an improved version of an existing system and to only use Java.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    I chose to create an ordering system for a local takeaway, which would allow users to order food from the comfort of their own home.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    This project allowed me to develop my programming skills in Java, and also allowed me to learn about the software development life cycle 
                    by using both waterfall and agile techniques throughout the development of my system, which I found to be very useful.

                        Coming up with a design for my project; figuring out which features to add and not add was found to be challenging
                        as I had to consider the time I had to complete the project and also the time I needed to be able to revise for upcoming exams and assessments.
                        I soon found out that many of the features I wanted to add were not possible mainly due to time constraints, so I had to settle for a more basic design.

                    <p>
                        The system includes a login page where the user can either login or create a new account which they will be redirected
                        to a different page. Login details are encoded in base64 and stored in a text file, which is read from and/or written to 
                        when the user logs in or creates an account. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I would have like to have added a feature where login details are stored in a database,
                        but I did not because of programming limitations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After logging into the system, customers are greeted with the menu page where they can filter, search and select for the food they want to order
                        by double clicking on the item in the menu which will automatically add it to their basket which can be shown on the right. They can also remove nav-items
                        from their basket by double clicking on the item in the basket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would have liked to add a feature where the user can add a note to their order and, also a feature
                        where the user can filter the menu by allergens, but I did not because of the time constraints.

                <div class="desc">
                    <p>
                        When the user has placed their order, they can then go to the current orders page where they can see their order and the total price of their order.
                        They may order more food by going back to the menu page and adding more items to their basket.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I would have liked to have made this page a lot nicer but I could not find a way without making my project more complex than it already was.

                        Users can earn points for each completed order which they can then use to get free food, where the more points they have,
                        the more free food they can get. When a user claims their free food, the food is automatically added to their basket, which they can then order.
                        This is so that users are encouraged to use the system more often.
